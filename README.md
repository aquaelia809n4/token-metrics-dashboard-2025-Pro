## üîÑ Exchange Integration & API Support

Of course. Here is a detailed description of how a token-metrics-dashboard would integrate with major cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken for automated trading and portfolio management.

### Core Concept: The API Bridge

The integration is fundamentally built on **Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)** provided by the exchanges. The dashboard does not directly "log in" to your exchange account like a human would. Instead, it uses a set of secure keys to communicate and issue commands programmatically.

There are two main types of API keys used:

1.  **API Key:** Acts as a username for the application.
2.  **Secret Key:** Acts as a password. It is used to cryptographically sign all requests, ensuring they are authentic and have not been tampered with.

**Important Security Note:** Reputable dashboards only require **"Read" and "Trade"** permissions. **Never grant "Withdraw" permissions** to a third-party dashboard, as this would allow it to move funds out of your exchange account.

### The Integration Workflow for Automated Trading

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of how the dashboard interacts with an exchange to execute an automated trade.
